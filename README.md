# üìå Real-Time Chat Application (Frontend)

This project is a **modern real-time chat application frontend** built with **React.js** and **WebSockets**. It provides an engaging, responsive, and user-friendly interface that allows users to communicate instantly. The app is designed with professionalism and functionality in mind, balancing a **colorful UI** with **practical chat features** such as message history, search, emoji integration, editing and deletion, and user authentication.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tasks Performed

1. **UI/UX Design and Layout**

   * Designed a **responsive chat interface** using React components.
   * Created **multi-page navigation**: a login/authentication page and a dedicated chat page.
   * Optimized layouts for different screen sizes, ensuring the app works seamlessly across desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.

2. **User Authentication (Frontend)**

   * Developed a simple login interface where users enter a name before joining the chat.
   * Implemented session persistence using **localStorage**, allowing users to remain logged in until they choose to log out.
   * Added a **logout button** to clear the session and redirect users back to the authentication page.

3. **Real-Time Messaging Integration**

   * Integrated **WebSocket (socket.io-client)** to enable instant message sending and receiving without refreshing the page.
   * Ensured messages appear in real-time for all connected users.
   * Displayed sender information, timestamps, and message history.

4. **Message Management Features**

   * **Message History:** Messages are persisted so that users can see past conversations when they log back in.
   * **Message Search:** Implemented a search functionality that filters messages by keywords.
   * **Message Editing & Deletion:** Users can edit or delete their own messages, providing flexibility and control over conversations.

5. **Emoji & Sticker Integration**

   * Built a lightweight emoji picker for expressive chatting.
   * Optimized the emoji panel so it does not overwhelm the chat window.
   * (Optional) Support for custom GIFs or stickers using APIs such as **Giphy**.

6. **Frontend Enhancements**

   * Added animations and smooth transitions for an engaging user experience.
   * Used **localStorage** to save user preferences such as theme, username, and chat history.
   * Refined buttons, icons, and overall color palette to make the UI vibrant yet professional.
